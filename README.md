Developed a web application using Flask that allows users to upload job-related PDFs. The systemefficiently identifies fake job listings, helping users to avoid scams.
• Designed and Developed the web application using Flask, ensuring a seamless and user-friendlyexperience.
• Tokenized and Processed text data using Keras Tokenizer, transforming job descriptions into sequences for LSTM processing.
• Trained and Integrated an LSTM-based machine learning model for accurate detection of fake jobpostings, improving prediction reliability.
• Tested and Validated the model using train-test split to ensure high accuracy and reliable performance in detecting fake job postings.
Tools: Flask, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
